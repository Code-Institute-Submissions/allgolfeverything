All Golf Everything
====== 

This application (app) has been designed and coded for the 'Data Centric Development' milestone project in the Full Stack Developer 
course at the Code Institute.

The app is designed to be a resource for club golfers to use in order to make informed buying decisions on new purchases, 
share information on golf related gear and generally keep informed of new developments on and off the golf course.

Rather than relying solely on reviews from editors or journalists, All Golf is aimed at providing an open sharing platform
for amateur golfers to share their honest opinions on experiences they've had with particular products.

Project Speicifcations / Criteria
=====

###Project Example Idea
Build a book review and recommendation site.

###External userâ€™s goal:
Find books they would like to read.

###Site owner's goal:
Earn money on each book purchased via a link from the site.

###Potential features to include:
Create a web application that allows users to upload details of books, including book name, author name, link to cover image and any other relevant fields. 
Allow users to write comments about any book and upvote it.

###Create the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new books and reviews to the site, edit them and delete them.

###Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have):
Add a link such as the following to each book page, such that you could conceivably earn money from people looking to buy the book: https://www.amazon.com/s?tag=faketag&k=alice+in+wonderland 
Note that we do not actually encourage you to create an affiliate link, but rather want to demonstrate how this could work. 
Instead, for this project, we encourage you to just keep the tag value as something fake. 
Also, note that in general it's better to link directly to the book's page in the store, but that's a bit more difficult.
